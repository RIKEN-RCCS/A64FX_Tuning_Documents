<p>The followings are the target performance and conditions for tuning the
Application.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Target performance</p>
<p>The execution time of the initial A64FX version of the Application
was about two times longer than the x86 version. Therefore, to
achieve the same or better than the performance of the x86 version,
the target performance was decided to reduce the execution time by
more than half.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Conditions</p>
<p>The followings are the conditions in this tuning work.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Compilation</p>

<li><p>Model: Aerodynamics of transonic-flow around aircraft (14 million

<p>* Typically, the calculation of this model requires to be iterated
until steady state is achieved. But in this case, the number of
iterations was fixed at 100.
This model was selected for its ease of performance evaluation. It
might be smaller than the model used in the larger-scale
simulations that most users require, but it is expected that tuning
improvements with this model would also be effective to
larger-scale simulations.</p>

<p>The following is the procedure of tuning the Application.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Evaluate the performance of the Application</strong></p>
<p>The execution time of the entire Application before performing the
tuning, this document refers to the version before tuning as the
initial version, was measured in order to use for comparison with the
performance after performing the tuning. Also, the execution time of
each measurement region, which was defined as each algorithm or a
bulk of algorithms, was measured in order to make it easier to
evaluate the effects of tuning. The measurement results are described
in Section 3.1 (<a class="reference internal" href="../section3/index.html#elapsedtime"><span class="std std-ref">Evaluation of the performance</span></a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Measure the cost of each function</strong></p>
<p>Since the Application is too large and complex, it was difficult to
use the fapp (Fujitsu Advanced Performance Profiler) for measuring the
performance information of the entire Application or the measurement
region. Therefore, fipp (Fujitsu Instant Performance Profiler) was used for
measuring the cost of each function in the Application to focus on
the target functions for tuning, then fapp was used for measuring the
performance information of such functions or loops (in step 3). The
measurement results of fipp are described in Section 3.2 (<a class="reference internal" href="../section3/index.html#fippcost"><span class="std std-ref">Cost of each function</span></a>).</p>
<p>Note that usage of the profiler is described in “Development Studio
Profiler User’s Guide” on the user portal.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Tune the Application</strong></p>
<p>The following procedure, from 3-1 to 3-4, was repeated to achieve the target performance.
In this tuning work, each tuning item described in Section 3.3.1 (<a class="reference internal" href="../section3/index.html#tuninglist"><span class="std std-ref">Tuning items</span></a>)
covers performing a series of steps from 3-1 to 3-4.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>3-1. <strong>Select the target for tuning</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The tuning priority was determined based on the cost of each function
(output by fipp), and the source code was checked starting from the
function with the high cost, and then functions containing loops with
potential for performance improvement were selected as targets for
tuning. On the other hand, some functions, even with low cost, were
also selected as targets for tuning if it was expected to improve the
entire Application performance.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>3-2. <strong>Analyze</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The functions or loops selected as tuning target in step 3-1 were
analyzed with the compiler optimization messages and/or the results
of fapp, and then the tuning plan was determined. In some cases,
tuning priorities were changed or abandoned in view of the ease of
tuning and prospects for performance improvement.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>3-3. <strong>Tune</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Tuning was performed according to the tuning plan that was
determined in step 3-2.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>3-4. <strong>Evaluate</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The performance after performing the tuning was evaluated using the
fipp or fapp as follows.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>fipp</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Using fipp, the cost information of target functions and the entire
Application before performing the tuning of step 3-3 is compared with
that after performing the tuning.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>fapp</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Using fapp, after narrowing region of the evaluation, “cycle
accounting” before performing the tuning of step 3-3 was compared
with that after performing the tuning. “cycle accounting” represents
the breakdown of execution time of a program per process. In each
graph of “cycle accounting” in the following sections, “cycle
accounting” of 12 processes which were allocated onto one CMG (Core
Memory Group) was shown. Note that region of the evaluation using
fapp depends on the tuning items.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Measure the performance of the Application</strong></p>
<p>After performing the tuning, the execution time was measured in the same
way as in step 1. The measurement results are described in Section
3.3.2 (<a class="reference internal" href="../section3/index.html#tuningresult"><span class="std std-ref">Tuning results</span></a>). As a result, 44 times of tuning (step 3) and 13 times of
measuring the performance of the Application (step 4) was performed in
this tuning work.</p>
